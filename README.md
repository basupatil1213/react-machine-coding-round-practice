# React Machine Coding Round Practice

This README is about all the React components I create as part of machine coding round practice for React.

## Overview

This repository contains various React components and applications that I have developed to practice and improve my skills in React. Each component is designed to solve a specific problem or implement a particular feature commonly encountered in real-world applications.

## Components

1. **OTP Form Application**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-machine-coding-round-practice.git

   ```
3. Move to the particular project you want to take a look at

4. Install the dependencies:
